# textgan-for-spanish
This is a textgan for generating spanish by pythorch.    
The corpus is crawled by LinguaBooster, and selected 50000 sentences.  
The project has some problems on windows and worked on linux well.  
I used two gan model which are seqgan and realgan.  
  
SeqGAN - SeqGAN: Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets with Policy Gradient  
RelGAN - RelGAN: Relational Generative Adversarial Networks for Text Generation
